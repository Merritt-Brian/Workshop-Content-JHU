[NAME] partners have developed a combination of complete training courses and individual modules. Individual courses have been categorized into four main categories: theory, laboratory, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics. Most of the individual modules are included as part of [complete training courses]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/training/courses.md %}), but they may also be viewed on their own to gain expertise on individual topics.

Below you will find the **BaseStack** modules. These are bioinformatics modules that walk you through the process of converting raw sequencing data into complete pathogen genomes using a specific software called BaseStack.
