[NAME] partners have developed a combination of complete training courses and individual modules. Individual courses have been categorized into four main categories: theory, laboratory, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics. Most of the individual modules are included as part of [complete training courses]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/training/courses.md %}), but they may also be viewed on their own to gain expertise on individual topics.

Below you will find the **SARS-CoV-2** modules. These modules discuss genomic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
