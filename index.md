The [NAME] aims to create, highlight, and distribute training materials related to pathogen sequencing, bioinformatics, and genomic epidemiology analysis. These materials are freely available online. Periodically, these materials are taught as part of in-person or virtual intensive training workshops, often with a particular pathogen in mind. We also maintain a Slack Workspace, where users can ask questions to other users and experienced trainers about laboratory protocols, bioinformatics steps, or phylogenetic analysis.

Click here to access complete training courses, and click here to access individual training modules.

Interested in joining the Slack Workspace? Request access here.

If you are interested in being considered for participation in a future workshop (virtual or in-person), please fill out this form to tell us more about your goals and research questions.
